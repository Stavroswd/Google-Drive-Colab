# Google-Drive-Colab

This is the repository associated with my Medium Article in which i describe 
how to work in Google Colab with Google Drive. 

It provides the Notebook with all the necessary code and also and csv file and 
a zipped data folder containing other csv files. 

In order to play around simply upload all the repo stuff into one of your Google Drive 
folders and open the Notebook in Google Colab to run it.
